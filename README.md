<h3 align="center">A super-simple tool to change Windows default system font</h3>

#### How does it work?
Changing the default system font on Windows 10 might be a bit tricky.
You have to manually edit your registry to make Windows believe that
`Segoe UI` is not available in your system, and then setting your custom
font as a fallback for `Segoe UI` when it is not available.

This program does all this things for you, without the need of manually
editing the registry, and it also allows you to reset everything to its
original status by simply pressing a button.
No more worries to mistype your font name!

#### Is it a virus?
Of course it isn't, otherwise I wouldn't open source it ;P.
Windows considers it a trojan because it has to work with the system registry,
so it may potentially completely break you PC. To reassure you, I am posting
a VirusTotal scan with each release of the program. By the way, if you don't
trust me at all, you can run the scan yourself, or you can directly compile
the sources to make sure that the file is completely safe.
