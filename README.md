<h3 align="center">A super-simple tool to change Windows default system font</h3>

#### How does it work?
Changing the default system font on Windows 10 might be a bit tricky.
You have to manually edit your registry to make Windows believe that
`Segoe UI` is not available in your system, and then setting your custom
font as a fallback for `Segoe UI` when it is not available.

This program does all this things for you, without the need of manually
editing the registry, and it also allows you to reset everything to its
original status by simply pressing a button.
No more worries to mistype your font name!
